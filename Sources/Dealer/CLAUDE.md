# Code invariants

## Model (`Model.swift`)

- One generic binary tree, `Node<Leaf>`, serves both levels: `Node<Pane>` inside a `Tab`, and
  `Node<Deck>` for the window.
- **Nodes are reference types on purpose.** Fold origins (`FoldOrigin`), the "select parent"
  selection, and dividers all hold on to specific `Node` objects.
  - Mutate trees only through `Node.insert` / `Node.remove`, which re-parent the existing nodes.
  - Rebuilding or copying a tree silently breaks fold-back-to-origin.
- `Node.remove` returns the new root, or `nil` when the tree becomes empty. Callers must store it.

## Controller (`TerminalWindowController.swift`)

- Every structural operation ends with `finishChange(focus:)`, which clears the selection and
  any stale zoom, lays out, and restores focus.
- `detach(node:from:in:)`, `detach(tab:from:)` and `detach(deck:)` cascade: an empty tab removes
  itself from its deck, and an empty deck is removed from the window tree. `finishChange` closes
  the window when the root becomes `nil`.
- Moves detach first, then insert. Re-`locate` the target after detaching, because the source's
  cleanup can reshape the tree the target lives in.
- `root`, `focusedPane` and `selection` are `private(set)`. Code that assigns them, such as
  `restore`, must live in this file.

## Layout and views

- Layout is recomputed from the model on every pass: `WindowContentView.layout()` →
  `layoutWindow()` → `layout(deck:)`. Views are cached on the model (`Deck.view` is lazy,
  `Pane.view`, `Pane.surface`), so a pass only sets frames and visibility.
- **Hide surfaces; don't remove them.** Panes in background tabs, and decks hidden by a
  window-level zoom, get `isHidden = true` plus `surface.setVisible(false)`
  (ghostty occlusion). Reparenting a pane between decks is just `addSubview`.
- Divider views are pooled (`syncDividers`), so the divider being dragged survives the relayout
  that its own drag triggers. Don't recreate them per pass.
- All custom views are flipped (top-left origin). `SurfaceView` is flipped too, so mouse and
  IME coordinates go to ghostty unconverted.
- Overlays (drop highlight, selection, drag ghost) must stay above the Metal layers. Call
  `contentView.raiseOverlays()` after adding subviews.

## libghostty lifetime and threading

- A `SurfaceView` owns its `ghostty_surface_t` and frees it in `deinit`.
  - Keep a `Pane` strongly referenced only from its tree node.
  - Every closure capturing a pane or the controller must capture it `weak`, or the shell
    process leaks.
- The `wakeup_cb` and clipboard callbacks can arrive off the main thread. `wakeup` hops to main
  and calls `ghostty_app_tick`. `close_surface_cb` dispatches the close asynchronously to main;
  never free a surface synchronously inside a ghostty callback.
- `ghostty_init` and `ghostty_app_new` run once, in `GhosttyRuntime.start()`. That function
  also sets `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` from `/Applications/Ghostty.app` so shell integration and
  terminfo work.
